* This project runs in a Docker container.
  The root of the project is mounted to the container.
  See docker.sh for details.
* The host system is running NixOS.
  I have copied (I would like to symlink, but Docker)
  the system's NixOS configuration to the folder host-nix-config-copy/.
* The idea of the project
  is to read and write MIDI to and from the host system.
