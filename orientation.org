* This project runs in a Docker container.
  The root of the project is mounted to the container.
  See docker.sh for how it's launched.
  Permissions matter -- it needs access to audio (or at least midi,
  but I think both are bundled in the 'audio' group).
* The host system is running NixOS.
  I have copied (I would like to symlink, but Docker)
  the system's NixOS configuration to the folder host-nix-config-copy/.
* The idea of the project
  is to read and write MIDI to and from the host system.
* Pitfalls
** To read MIDI data without freezing
   Don't read raw binary data from MIDI devices directly,
   because that blocks indefinitely.
   Use aseqdump with timeout and head:
   : timeout 10s aseqdump -p 20:0 2>&1 | head -20
   To list available MIDI devices:
   : aconnect -l
   : amidi -l
